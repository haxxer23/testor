	This class provides key-value storage of arbitrary data in the database.

	suitable for storing in the database. This object, once initialized,
	provides an interface just like a standard dictionary object. An optional
	namespace can be specified as a unique identifier, allowing different
	sources to store data using the same keys. All keys must be strings but
	data can be anything that is serializable.
