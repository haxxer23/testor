GObject Signals
===============

These signals can be used by the client API and plugins to subscribe to
specific events. To explicitly connect after the default handler for a signal,
use the *connect_after* method instead of *connect*. Some signals require a
value to be returned by their handlers as noted.

Application Signals
-------------------

The following are the signals for the
:py:class:`~king_phisher.client.application.KingPhisherClientApplication`
object.

.. py:function:: campaign-changed(campaign_id)

   This signal is emitted when campaign attributes are changed. Subscribers to
   this signal can use it to update and refresh information for the modified
   campaign.

   :signal flags: ``SIGNAL_RUN_FIRST``
   :param str campaign_id: The ID of the campaign whose information was changed.

.. py:function:: campaign-created(campaign_id)

   This signal is emitted after the user creates a new campaign id. Subscribers
   to this signal can use it to conduct an action after a new campaign id is created.

   :signal flags: ``SIGNAL_RUN_FIRST``
   :param str campaign_id: The ID of the new campaign.

.. py:function:: campaign-delete(campaign_id)

   This signal is emitted when the user deletes a campaign. Subscribers
   to this signal can use it to conduct an action after the campaign is deleted.

   :signal flags: ``SIGNAL_ACTION | SIGNAL_RUN_LAST``
   :param str campaign_id: The ID of the campaign.

.. py:function:: campaign-set(campaign_id)

   This signal is emitted when the user sets the current campaign. Subscribers
   to this signal can use it to update and refresh information for the current
   campaign.

   :signal flags: ``SIGNAL_RUN_FIRST``
   :param str campaign_id: The ID of the campaign.

.. py:function:: config-load(load_defaults)

   This signal is emitted when the client configuration is loaded from disk. This
   loads all of the clients settings used within the GUI.

   :signal flags: ``SIGNAL_ACTION | SIGNAL_RUN_LAST``
   :param bool load_defaults: Load missing options from the template configuration file.

.. py:function:: config-save()

   This signal is emitted when the client configuration is written to disk. This
   saves all of the settings used within the GUI so they can be restored at a
   later point in time.

   :signal flags: ``SIGNAL_ACTION | SIGNAL_RUN_LAST``

.. py:function:: credential-delete(row_ids)

   This signal is emitted when the user deletes a credential entry. Subscribers
   to this signal can use it to conduct an action an entry is deleted.

   client is disconnected from the server. At this point the exit operation can
   not be cancelled.

   :signal flags: ``SIGNAL_ACTION | SIGNAL_RUN_LAST``

.. py:function:: exit-confirm()

   This signal is emitted when the client has requested that the application
   exit. Subscribers to this signal can use it as a chance to display a warning
   dialog and cancel the operation.

   :type row_ids: [str, ...]

.. py:function:: message-sent(target_uid, target_email)

.. py:function:: sftp-client-start()

   This signal is emitted when the client starts sftp client from within
   King Phisher. Subscribers can conduct an action prior to the default option
   being ran from the client configuration.

   :return: Whether or not the handler's pre-check condition has passed.
   :rtype: bool

Server Event Signals
--------------------

The following are the signals for the

active subscriptions. When an event is forwarded to a client the corresponding
GObject signal is emitted for consumption by the client. See the section on
:ref:`server-published-events-label` for more details.
